MenloFramework can be introduced by examining and working with
the follow projects. Each project is complete, and may be used
to build an application scenario that matches the requirements
of what features it supports.

                 *** MenloBlink ***

                Classic "Blink" example

This application blinks an LED at a built in interval.

The MenloFramework version of the classic Blink example introduces
initializing the core framework and using its MenloTimer class to
timer and event driven programming.

It provides an example of the "boilerplate" setup for an Arduino "Sketch"
project that is similar to all MenloFramework applications.

It provides an example of the Menloframework's organization in which the
Arduino Sketch contains application configuration data, and the main logic
is built from MenloFramework classes.

A C++ class is created in the project to represent the unique application
state.

Since this leverages the MenloFramework debug print, watchdog,
power management and timers are available for even this simple application.


                 *** MenloDweetBlink ***

          Addition of MenloDweet to the MenloBlink example

This application blinks an LED at a configurable interval.

By adding MenloDweet the blink interval is now configurable over the
Arduino serial (USB) port. It uses a NMEA 0183 based command set called
"MenloDweet" to provide configuration and state commands.

NMEA 0183 is a serial line protocol originally developed for marine
navigation, and has become the standard protocol for GPS's everywhere.

The configured interval is saved to EEPROM, and automatically loaded
at power on, reset.

Since the additional MenloDweet support framework classes are used
additional product level commands are available such as managing power
management settings, setting and retrieving model number, serial number,
and manufacturer data, etc. In addition debug classes may be enabled to
allow remove low level query/modification of the embedded systems
state.

The application and debug streams are separated allowing an application
to sort output based on its NMEA 0183 prefix.

MenloDweetBlink introduces the table driven pattern which binds application
defined commands to properties of the application class. These properties
automatically have configured storage in EEPROM and their settings are
restored on power on/reset ensuring the device is always operating in
the correctly configured state.

MenloDweetBlink also introduces Menlo Application Framework classes
in which class DweetSerialApp provides the template for fully featured
application using Dweet over serial lines. The applications class remains
focused just on the applications properties, commands, and logic.

Introducing MenloDweet over a serial/USB line brings your application
into the Internet Of Things (IoT) by using the Menlo Dweet Node.js
gateway on a RaspberryPi, Mac, PC, or Linux computer. Plugging your
device into the USB of any computer capable of running Node.js and
USB serial port enables local, or remote Cloud communication and
control for your device/project.

Introduces the DweetSerialApp framework.

                 *** MenloRadioDweetBlink ***

          Remote control DweetBlink over a low power radio

This adds support for remote Menlo Dweet commands over a low power
radio (Nordic nRF24L01).

This also demonstrates how the new set of Radio control Dweets
are automatically added as a result of including the DweetRadio
component in the application. DweetRadio not only adds the DweetRadio
commands, but also handles the radio's power on/reset configuration.


Introduces the DweetRadioSerialApp framework.

                 *** Sensor *** 
                 *** IoT Sensor *** 

  A cloud connected sensor network application over a low power radio.

This is a complete "sensor network" application which utilizes an inexpensive
low power consumption radio (Nordic nRF24L01, $1.89, 13ma) to connect to the
cloud through a gateway.

The gateway is another instance of the sensor connected over USB serial
to a computer running the Menlo Dweet Node.js gateway software. As with
DweetSerial this computer may be any computer that runs Node.js with
USB serial support. This includes RaspberryPi, Mac, PC, or Linux computer.

The gateway hardware could also be a low cost board such as an Arduino Uno,
Nano, ProMini, etc. with a Nordic nRF24L01 radio module and connected to
USB serial.

The sensor can be "factory configured" by connecting it to a USB port
on a computer and running a Node.js based setup application. Once factory
configured, it can be managed remotely over the radio through the gateway.

The gateway provides configurable local logging, connection to various
device cloud providers (Cosm, Azure, etc.), and the ability to create,
configure, and run local "rules" for IoT integration scenarios, home
automation, etc.

The project is configured to allow the class providing the hardware
functions to be separated from the main project allowing re-use of
the standard application pattern across diverse hardware sensors
from commonly available ones to custom designs.

Introduces the MenloRadioSensorApp framework.

                 *** LightHouse *** 

        A cloud environmental monitoring lighthouse

This is a real world application in which a lighthouse or navigational
buoy is configured for a programmed light sequence. This sequence is stored
in the EEPROM and automatically retrieved at power on, reset.

Built in logic turns the light on at night, and off during the day maximizing
battery charge.

The light sequence, light turn on threshold, and other operating modes
of the lighthouse are real time configurable through MenloDweet's and
saved in EEPROM for power on start/reset.

The lighthouse is connected by a low power radio (Nordic nRF24L01) to a gateway
in addition to the available Dweet serial port for remote configuration,
control, and monitoring.

The lighthouse is solar powered with an on board rechargeable battery so it
leverages the MenloPower CPU energy saving modes in edition to MenloRadio's
power management to schedule periodic updates mostly saving the battery.

The periodic update rate is configurable through MenloDweet and saved
in EEPROM.

Monitoring of the battery voltage, solar panel voltage, ambient light,
sea level/moisture, and temperature is done.

The lighthouse can be remote controlled through the gateway and
the radio using MenloDweet.

The lighthouse is used to build multiple "real world" products:

1) Ornamental Lighthouse which can flash a users favorite lighthouse
or sea buoy pattern. Colors, rates, period are configurable.

Basic environmental monitoring of temperature, light is provided in
addition to battery condition.

2) Garden monitoring Lighthouse that can determine when grass or
plants require watering through a soil moisture sensor, in addition
to light and temperature conditions.

The light can be used in a Lighthouse fashion, or as a garden/walkway
light with selectable colors and brightness.

3) Lighthouse Weather Station. Additional sensors are provided
for wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, and optional GPS location.

This information is provided in addition to the light and temperature
functions. The lighthouse light function can continue to function
as a lighthouse, or garden light.

This product operates using a larger external solar panel and
wind/rain measuring equipment.

All of the above products connect to the Cloud through a gateway
as an IoT (Internet of Things) application.

Uses the MenloRadioSensorApp framework and introduces the de-composition
of a more complex application into multiple parts:

DweetLightHouse - Dweet commands handler for LightHouse

MenloLightHouse - Event driven lighthouse signal/light sequence generator
                  Raises events to change light state.

LightHouseApp   - LightHouse application framework

LightHouseHardware - Abstract the hardware for controlling the light
                  and reading the environmental monitoring sensors.

Note that this application is at the "hairy edge" of capacity of
an AtMega328 with 32k flash and 2k RAM. Current flash consumption
is 29,608 bytes and memory is carefully balanced between stack
initialized data, and minimal runtime heap space.
